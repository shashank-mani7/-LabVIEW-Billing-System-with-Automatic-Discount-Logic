🧾 LabVIEW Smart Billing System

A LabVIEW-based billing application that calculates item totals and automatically applies discounts based on purchase amount.
Built to demonstrate dataflow programming, arithmetic operations, and decision logic using LabVIEW block diagrams.

📌 Project Overview

This VI simulates a small billing system where users can:

Select multiple items

Enter quantities

View automatic total calculation

Apply conditional discount logic

Get final discounted price output

The project focuses on LabVIEW fundamentals like Boolean controls, numeric operations, comparison blocks, and case structures.

⚙️ Features

4 selectable items

Adjustable quantities

Fixed price inputs

Automatic total calculation

Tier-based discount system

Real-time discounted price output

🧠 Logic Used

Quantity × Price for each item

Sum of all items → Total

Comparison nodes check total thresholds

Case Structure applies discount

Final Price = Total − (Total × Discount Rate)

🖥️ Front Panel

Controls:

Item selection buttons

Quantity inputs

Price indicators

Outputs:

Total amount

Discount %

Discounted price

🏗️ Block Diagram Concepts

Boolean to numeric conversion

Multiply & Add functions

Greater-than comparison blocks

Case Structure decision logic

🚀 How to Run

Open the .vi file in NI LabVIEW.

Set quantities or prices.

Select items.

Run the VI to calculate totals and discounts.

🧰 Requirements

NI LabVIEW

Basic understanding of LabVIEW controls and indicators

📈 Possible Improvements

Replace repeated blocks with loops/arrays

Dynamic item handling

Better UI alignment

Input validation

If you want something stronger for GitHub (because honestly this still looks like a basic college project), I can rewrite a more professional README that makes it sound like a structured engineering project instead of a classroom exercise.
